# Webpack-boilerplate

Webpack-boilerplate is a project that provides Webpack 4 boilerplates out-of-box to quickstart development. I decided to create it after writing a couple of Medium blogposts:
- [A tale of Webpack 4 and how to finally configure it in the right way.](https://hackernoon.com/a-tale-of-webpack-4-and-how-to-finally-configure-it-in-the-right-way-4e94c8e7e5c1)

- [How to streamline your React.js development process using Webpack 4.](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-to-develop-react-js-apps-fast-using-webpack-4-3d772db957e4)

I don`t believe in universal configurations and boilerplates when it comes to confugaration files. I believe every project should be treated and configured individually. Yet, there is a set of good practices that can help you with minimal project setup.

This project is a collection of Webpack setups I find useful that you can copy directly and start using on your project. They are not limited to only Webpack, but also have ESLint and Stylelint configured for more convenience.
